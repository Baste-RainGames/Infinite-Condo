# Infinite-Condo
This condio is infinite, yo

This was made for Global Game Jam 2019.

Tetris meets The Sims meets a shark.

You're building the Infinite Condo. The people living there want to go to different kinds of rooms, but only want to go upwards, for reasons that will soon be clear. You have to build the rooms they want to go, and the stairs to get them there.

The shark is a complication.
